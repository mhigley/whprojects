    <p>I enjoy long, <span class="adjective">[ADJECTIVE]</span> walks on the beach, getting <span class="verb">[VERB]</span> in the rain and serendipitous encounters with <span class="plural">[PLURAL NOUN]</span>. I really like piña coladas mixed with <span class="liquid">[LIQUID]</span>, and romantic, candle-lit <span class="plural">[PLURAL NOUN]</span>. I am well-read from Dr. Seuss to <span class="famous">[FAMOUS PERSON]</span>. I travel frequently, especially to <span class="place">[PLACE]</span>, when I am not busy with work. (I am a <span class="occupation">[OCCUPATION]</span>.) I am looking for <span class="noun">[NOUN]</span> and beauty in the form of a <span class="nationality">[NATIONALITY]</span> goddess. She should have the physique of <span class="celebrity">[FEMALE CELEBRITY]</span> and the <span class="noun">[NOUN]</span> of <span class="friend">[FEMALE FRIEND]</span>. I would prefer if she knew how to cook, clean, and wash my <span class="plural">[PLURAL NOUN]</span>. I know I’m not very attractive in my picture, but it was taken <span class="number">[NUMBER]</span> days ago, and I have since become more <span class="adjective">[ADJECTIVE]</span>.</p>
